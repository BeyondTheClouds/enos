#+TITLE: Script to bundle enos with its resources

This scenario starts a VM thanks to Vagrant and then installs enos and
tests a basic OpenStack deployment. At the end of the provision phase,
the Vagrant box is ready to be exported with ~vagrant package~. The
result is a self-contained box with all enos dependencies, including
OpenStack kolla images. So, someone could use this box to test enos in
an offline environment.

* Building the box
Start box provisioning:
: vagrant up

Build the box:
: vagrant package

* Using the box
Configure a new Vagrantfile with the fresh box (see
~Vagrantfile.sample~ for configuration example). Then start it and SSH
on it. Now, inside the box go into the ~/opt/enos~ directory and load
the virtual environment:

From now, you can try enos:
: python -m enos.enos deploy -f reservation.yaml

* Customization
Someone can change the version of enos by modifying ~ENOS~ values in
the vagrant file. You can also change the ~reservation.yml~ to tune
the deployed OpenStack.

* Jenkins is using it

Jenkins is using it to test the static provider.
