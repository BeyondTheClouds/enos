# ENOS NOTE
# A difference between external-compute and internal-compute is made in stable/queens
# see: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/510327/
# and: https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/neutron/pike.html#prelude
# in short internal-compute floating ips will be associated at the centralized network node
# For the record this is configured as follow in the original inventory:
# inner-compute is the groups of compute nodes which do not have
# external reachability
# [inner-compute]

# external-compute is the groups of compute nodes which can reach
# outside
# [external-compute]
# compute01

# [compute:children]
# inner-compute
# external-compute

# In EnOS we consider for now that all the computes are external

# When compute nodes and control nodes use different interfaces,
# you need to comment out "api_interface" and other interfaces from the globals.yml
# and specify like below:
#compute01 neutron_external_interface=eth0 api_interface=em1 storage_interface=em1 tunnel_interface=em1

# Additional control implemented here. These groups allow you to control which
# services run on which hosts at a per-service level.
#
# Word of caution: Some services are required to run on the same host to
# function appropriately. For example, neutron-metadata-agent must run on the
# same host as the l3-agent and (depending on configuration) the dhcp-agent.
