Grid'5000
=========


Installation
-------------

Connect to the frontend of your choice.
Then, refer to the :ref:`installation` section to install Enos.

Configuration
-------------

The provider relies on cluster names to group the wanted resources. For example
the following is a valid resources description :

.. code-block:: yaml

    provider: g5k

    resources:
      paravance:
        control: 1
        network: 1
      parsilo:
        compute: 10


Deployment
-----------

We suggest you to run the deployment from a dedicated node (especially for large
deployment). For now the recommended way to do so is to reserve one node prior
of your reservation. In the case of an interactive deployment:

.. code-block:: bash

    frontend) oarsub -I -l 'walltime=2:00:00'
    node) source venv/bin/activate
    node) <edit configuration>
    node) enos deploy

Enos will need to access the G5K api from this node. In order to do so you need
to instruct execo to use the external endpoint of the API :

.. code-block:: bash

    cat ~/.execo.conf.py:

    g5k_configuration = {
        'api_username': '<your login>',
        'api_uri': "https://api-ext.grid5000.fr/3.0/",
    }

You will be asked for your password at start.

Default provider configuration
-------------------------------

The provider comes with the following default options :

.. code-block:: yaml

      provider:
        type: g5k
        name: Enos
        walltime: 02:00:00
        env_name: jessie-x64-min
        reservation: None
        role_distribution: strict
        single_interface: false
        user: root
        networks: 2

They can be overriden in the configuration file.

Network management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At a glance, the provider can configure several networks. Those networks are
provided by different vlans in the Grid'5000 world. The provider then configure
each network interface of the reserved nodes to use the right network. The
provider finally returns the list of the networks configured so that EnOS can map
them to those used by OpenStack.

More deeply, the `network` key controls the number of vlans to reserve.

- If you request more networks than the number of network cards on your nodes,
  EnOS will reduce this number in order to put each available network interface
  in a dedicated vlan.
- If you request less networks than the number of network cards on your nodes,
  EnOs will let some of the network interfaces unconfigured.

You can skip the previous mecanism by providing a `vlan` key.

.. code-block:: yaml

    provider:
      type: g5k
      ...
      vlan:
        rennes: "{type='kavlan'}/vlan=1"

.. note::

    The number of available vlans is limited in Grid'5000. For instance,
    maximum 3 simultaneous deployments with `networks: 2` in the same site can
    be running.
