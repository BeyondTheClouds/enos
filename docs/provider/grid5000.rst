Grid'5000
=========


Installation
-------------

Connect to the frontend of your choice.
Then, refer to the :ref:`installation` section to install Enos.

If virtualenv is missing:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install virtualenv --user     # Install virtualenv
    $ export PATH=~/.local/bin/:${PATH} # Put it into your path


Configuration
-------------

The provider relies on cluster names to group the wanted resources. For example
the following is a valid resources description :

.. code-block:: yaml

    provider: g5k

    resources:
      paravance:
        control: 1
        network: 1
      parsilo:
        compute: 10


Deployment
-----------

We suggest you to run the deployment from a dedicated node (especially for large
deployment). For now the recommended way to do so is to reserve one node prior
of your reservation. In the case of an interactive deployment:

.. code-block:: bash

    frontend) oarsub -I -l 'walltime=2:00:00'
    node) source venv/bin/activate
    node) <edit configuration>
    node) enos deploy


Default provider configuration
-------------------------------

The provider comes with the following default options :

.. code-block:: yaml

      provider:
        type: g5k
        name: Enos
        walltime: 02:00:00
        env_name: debian9-x64-min
        reservation: None
        vlans: '{rennes: "{type=kavlan}/vlan=1"}'
        role_distribution: strict
        single_interface: false
        user: root

They can be overriden in the configuration file.
