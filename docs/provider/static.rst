Static
======

The static provider reuses already available resources (machines, network) to
deploy OpenStack on.

Installation
------------

Refer to the :ref:`installation` section to install Enos.

Configuration
-------------

The static provider requires already running resources to deploy
OpenStack on. Information in the provider description tells Enos
where these resources are and how to access to them. Concretely, you
have to fill the following information to properly configure Enos with
already running resources.

   provider:  # Configuration for the static provider
              # All keys are mandatory
     type: static
     networks: # An array of networks
     # one network looks like the following
       cidr: 192.168.0.0/24,
     # in case Enos needs to pick ips
     #  e.g : Kolla vips, Openstack ext-net ...
       start: 192.168.0.10,
       end: 192.168.0.50,
     # same as above but used in case you don't have
     # a contiguous set of ips
