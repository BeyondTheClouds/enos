Installation
------------

Connect to the frontend of your choice.
To install Enos, clone the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/BeyondTheClouds/enos

You should also choose to go with a virtualenv.

If virtualenv is missing:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install virtualenv --user # Install virtualenv
    $ export PATH=~/.local/bin/:${PATH} # Put it into your path

Then install the dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd enos
    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt


Configuration
-------------

To get started you can copy the sample configuration file and edit the resulting
file :

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cp reservation.yaml.sample reservation.yaml
    $ <editor> reservation.yaml

Using a persistent registry
---------------------------

The relevant configuration section looks like:

.. code-block:: yaml

    registry:
      ceph: true|false
      ceph_keyring: path to your keyring
      ceph_id: your ceph id
      ceph_rbd: rbd in the form "pool/rbd"

The deployment makes use of a private docker registry configured as a
mirror of the official docker registry. There are two modes :

  * `ceph: false`. It will start a fresh registry that will cache the images
    for the duration of the experiment.
  * `ceph: true`. It will use an existing Ceph rados block device of the Rennes
    cluster.

The block device will be mounted and used as the registry storage.
Setting this is useful as the cache will persist different
experiments.

[The G5k ceph tutorial ](https://www.grid5000.fr/mediawiki/index.php/Ceph) will
guide you on how to create your rados block device.


Deployment
-----------

To launch the deployment, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m enos.enos deploy

We suggest you to run the deployment from a dedicated node (especially for large
deployment). For now the recommended way to do so is to reserve one node prior
of your reservation. In the case of an interactive deployment :

.. code-block:: bash

    frontend) oarsub -I -l 'walltime=2:00:00'
    node) source venv/bin/activate
    node) <edit configuration>
    node) python -m enos.enos deploy
