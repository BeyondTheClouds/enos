Welcome to Enos's documentation!
================================

.. hint ::

   The source code is available at
   https://github.com/BeyondTheClouds/enos

Enos deploys OpenStack and targets reproducible experiments. It allows easy:

* deployment of the system
* customization of the system
* benchmarking of the system
* visualization of various metrics

Enos is developed in the context of the
`Discovery <https://beyondtheclouds.github.io/>`_ initiative.

Enos workflow
-------------

A typical experiment using Enos is the sequence of several phases:

* :code:`enos up` : Enos will read the configuration file, get machines from
  the resource provider and will prepare the next phase
* :code:`enos os` : Enos will deploy OpenStack on the machines. This phase rely
  highly on Kolla deployment.
* :code:`enos init-os` : Enos will bootstrap the OpenStack installation (default
  quotas, security rules, ...)
* :code:`enos bench` : Enos will run a list of benchmarks. Enos support Rally
  and Shaker benchmarks.
* :code:`enos backup` : Enos will backup metrics gathered, logs and
  configuration files from the experiment.
